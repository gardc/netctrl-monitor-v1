NetCTRL Monitor was my first real and big passion project / side project a couple of years ago. Even though I thought it could end up as a pretty impressive and feature-rich v2 with some work, and it still might, it never reached that point and the project died as a result.

P.S. **Thank you** to all the people who believed in the project and supported NetCTRL Monitor!
Also, beware this was my first project in Go, and the mantra was quick 'n dirty due to the limited time between work, university and life, so the code might not be top notch.

## ‚ùì What is it?

NetCTRL Monitor is a handy tool to monitor your home network, and with the ability to block devices through ARP spoofing. 

## Using Monitor

You'll need [this](https://github.com/gardc/netctrl-v1-monitor-remote-api) API service running.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. The frontend dev server will run
on http://localhost:34115. Open this in your browser to connect to your application.

## Building

For a production build, use `wails build`.
